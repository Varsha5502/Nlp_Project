<h1>Abstract or Overview:</h1>
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Twitter tweets. The main aim is to classify tweets into either positive or negative depending on their sentiment, enabling users to better understand the overall sentiment of a given text. The tool designed has a simple interface in which users may enter a text, and the model predicts the sentiment of that text.

<h1>Stakeholders and Benefits:</h1>
This tool would benefit marketers, brand managers, social media analysts, and customer support representatives. Marketers can measure public opinion on their products or campaigns, brand managers can monitor brand sentiment, social media analysts can analyze public sentiment patterns, and customer service representatives can quickly discover and respond to negative comments.

<h1>Data Description:</h1>
The data used for this project is a collection of Twitter tweets from various people. The dataset includes columns for tweet content, user IDs, timestamps, and other metadata. The text data was cleaned by removing stop words, URLs, email addresses, punctuation, and numbers. Following preprocessing, the data were ready for analysis.

<h1>Algorithm Description:</h1>
I have used logistic regression, a supervised learning algorithm. First, the text data is preprocessed, which includes lowercase, special character removal, and tokenization. Stopwords have been eliminated as well. The text is then transformed to numerical characteristics using the CountVectorizer. The logistic regression model is trained on these features to determine the sentiment of the tweets. New text inputs are preprocessed identically and fed into the trained model to predict their sentiment.

<h1>Tools Used:</h1>
<h3>1. Python</h3>: Used as the primary programming language for coding the project.
<h3>2. Scikit-learn</h3>: Utilized for implementing the logistic regression model, preprocessing text data, and evaluating model performance.
<h3>3. Streamlit</h3>: Used to create the web application interface for user interaction.
<h3>4. Pandas</h3>: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
<h3>5. Matplotlib</h3>: Used for data visualization, particularly for plotting the top 10 most frequent words.
<h3>6. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)</h3>: Used for tokenization and removing stopwords.

<h1>Ethical Concerns:</h1>
There are several ethical concerns associated with sentiment analysis, especially on social media data. Such as-
<h3>1. Privacy:</h3> Make sure that the tweets used in the study are anonymised and do not reveal sensitive information about individuals.
<h3>2. Bias:</h3> Be aware of any potential biases in the dataset and model predictions to ensure fairness and inclusion.
<h3>3. Misinterpretation:</h3> Users should be aware that sentiment analysis presents a simplified representation of complex beliefs and feelings. For a more full examination, the tool should be used in alongside other research approaches.
